# Off-Plan Properties 2026

## Project Overview

**Off-Plan Properties 2026** is a virtual reality (VR) visualization of a neighborhood with twin houses available for purchase from JPS Development. The project allows users to explore homes that are not yet built, offering an immersive experience to prospective homebuyers. This project was created as part of my dissertation for the Masterâ€™s Degree in Virtual Reality at Swansea University.

### Research Focus

The project addresses the research question:  
**How does VR influence the decision-making process of homebuyers in the real estate market?**

Through this immersive VR environment, the aim is to study how virtual property tours can impact a buyer's decision before physical construction begins.
